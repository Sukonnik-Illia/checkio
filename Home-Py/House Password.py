"""Stephan and Sophia forget about security and use simple passwords for
everything. Help Nikola develop a password security check module. The password
will be considered strong enough if its length is greater than or equal to 10
symbols, it has at least one digit, as well as containing one uppercase letter
and one lowercase letter in it. The password contains only ASCII latin letters
or digits.

Input: A password as a string (Unicode for python 2.7).

Output: Is the password safe or not as a boolean or any data type that can be
converted and processed as a boolean. In the results you will see the converted
results.
